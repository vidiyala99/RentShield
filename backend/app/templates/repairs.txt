RE: Request for Repairs at [Rental Property Address]

Dear [Landlord Name],

I am writing to formally request repairs to my rental unit at the address listed above. Specifically, I am experiencing the following issue(s):

{{ issue_details }}

I have previously notified you of this issue on [Date of First Notice] via {{ notice_method }}. To date, the issue has not been resolved.

Under North Carolina General Statute § 42-42, landlords are required to maintain the premises in a fit and habitable condition, including keeping all plumbing, sanitary, heating, ventilating, and air conditioning facilities in good and safe working order.

Please contact me immediately to schedule these repairs. I expect this issue to be resolved within {{ deadline_days }} days, or I may be forced to explore further legal remedies, including seeking rent abatement or contacting the local housing code enforcement agency.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
