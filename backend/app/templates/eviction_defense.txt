RE: Notice of Defense - Rent Abatement for [Rental Property Address]

Dear [Landlord Name],

I am writing in response to the recent notice/action regarding rent payment.

I acknowledge that rent is claimed to be due. However, I am asserting a defense based on the implied warranty of habitability under N.C.G.S. § 42-42. The following serious defects exist in the property:

{{ issue_details }}

Because the value of the rental unit has been significantly diminished by these issues, I believe I am entitled to a clear "rent abatement" (a reduction in the fair rental value). The amount I legally owe should be offset by the reduced value of the home during this period of disrepair.

I am prepared to discuss a reasonable settlement or payment plan that accounts for these conditions. If necessary, I will raise this counter-claim in Small Claims Court.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
